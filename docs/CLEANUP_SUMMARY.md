# MeridianAlgo Cleanup and Reorganization Summary

## ✅ Completed Cleanup Tasks

### 1. Root Directory Organization
- **Moved test files**: Consolidated all root-level test files (`test_*.py`) into `tests/integration/`
- **Created integration tests**: 
  - `test_backtesting_integration.py` - Event-driven backtesting framework tests
  - `test_ml_integration.py` - Machine learning and feature engineering tests  
  - `test_portfolio_integration.py` - Portfolio management and performance analytics tests
- **Added test runner**: `tests/integration/run_all_tests.py` for comprehensive test execution
- **Removed debug files**: Deleted `debug_tc.py`, `simple_ml_test.py` and other development artifacts
- **Removed .bat files**: Deleted all Windows batch files from root directory
- **Organized documentation**: Moved all .md files to `docs/` folder except README.md and LICENSE

### 2. Module Consolidation
- **Eliminated duplication**: Removed duplicate `portfolio_management/` module (consolidated into `portfolio/`)
- **Eliminated duplication**: Removed duplicate `data_processing/` module (functionality exists in `data/processing.py`)
- **Preserved functionality**: Moved useful `rebalancing.py` from old module to main `portfolio/` module
- **Updated imports**: Updated `portfolio/__init__.py` to include rebalancing functionality

### 3. Documentation Updates
- **Updated README.md**: Reflects new architecture and comprehensive feature set
- **Updated demo.py**: Shows the ultimate quant platform capabilities
- **Created comprehensive docs**: Added CHANGELOG.md, DEPLOYMENT.md, RELEASE_NOTES.md
- **Organized structure**: All documentation now in `docs/` folder
